C++ attempt for deep neural networks. 

# Approach
- Start with constructing basic feed-forward neural network 
- Train it with low dimensional data, implementing several optimisation schemes (momentum, Nesterov RMS, ..Â°
- Build GUI to notice behavior (overfit,..)
- Scale up (CNN, weight-sharing, higher dimensional data, ..)
